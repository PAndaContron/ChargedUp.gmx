# ChargedUp

Game for a high school physics project

Charged Up is a single-player game based on the concepts of electric force and kinematics.
Players are tasked with guiding a rocket to its target without any direct control over the rocket’s movement.
Instead, players change the rocket’s electric charge so that other charged objects move it around through the electric force.
In order to complete a level, the rocket must go from its starting point to its goal.
If the rocket hits anything or goes off the screen, the player must try again.

## Controls

* First, the player uses the left and right arrow keys to adjust the rocket’s charge.
* The player launches the rocket by pressing the space key, after which the player can no longer change the charge.
* The player can destroy the rocket manually by pressing R if it is clear that it is going to crash anyway.
* Hold down Control while using the arrow keys to change the charge faster.
* Press Escape to pause/unpause the game.
* Press F11 to toggle fullscreen mode.
